# Firebase Setup Instructions for BudgetNest

## Firebase Console Setup

1. **Go to Firebase Console**

2. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication â†’ Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
   - Click "Save"

3. **Enable Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Click "Create database"
   - Start in test mode (for development)
   - Choose a location (us-central1 recommended)

4. **Set up Firestore Rules** (for production):
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Users can only access their own data
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       match /budgets/{budgetId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
       }
       
       match /expenses/{expenseId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
       }
       
       match /lending/{lendingId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Firebase API Key Security

- The Firebase API key is now loaded from an environment variable (`.env` file) and is no longer hardcoded in the codebase.
- **Never commit your `.env` file or any secrets to a public repository.**
- If your API key was leaked, immediately rotate it in the Google Cloud Console and update your `.env` file with the new key.
- `.env` is now included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### How to set up your API key
1. Copy your new Firebase API key from the Google Cloud Console.
2. Open the `.env` file in the project root (create it if it doesn't exist).
3. Add this line (replace with your actual key):

   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```
4. Save the file. Restart your dev server if running.

### Rotating a Leaked Key
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and create a new API key.
- Replace the old key in your `.env` file.
- Delete or restrict the old key.
- Check your Google Cloud usage for suspicious activity.
